2024-08-30 18:36:56 - Assistant: Sure, here are some additional highlights from the brochure that demonstrate their focus on research and postgraduate education in Portugal:

1. Study abroad opportunities: Some of the study programs outlined include Portuguese language studies at one of Italy's highest ranked universities, a master's program taught in Portugal, and various European destinations for graduate-level courses on topics like Economics, Sociology, History, and Linguistics.
2. Career services: The brochure provides details about the Career Development Unit (UDA), which offers a range of support services, including career preparation workshops, job search strategies, resume writing advice, and interviews coaching.
3. Mentors: The brochure highlights mentor programs for students who plan to live in Portugal during their studies, providing guidance and support on student life, cultural immersion and living abroad.
4. Research opportunities: Portuguese research institutions are well known for their top research publications, and some include specific focuses or areas of expertise such as sustainability or environmental sciences. The brochure includes descriptions for various research programs and project opportunities suitable for graduate students in fields ranging from Chemistry to Zoology.
5. Internship opportunities: Portugal is a country rich with history, culture, and food, making it an excellent location for internships. In addition, international research projects like the Global Health, Environment & Development Consortium or the Digital Economy Laboratory are funded through various grant programs run by Portuguese institutions.
6. Business opportunities: The brochure provides information about the Global Entrepreneurship Programme and a range of initiatives offered by the local government to support student entrepreneurship, such as mentorship and business events, co-working spaces, and access to capital markets.
7. Study Abroad funding: Portugal has various study abroad programs for international students, including a program in China that offers English-taught language courses at top universities, which includes a $12,000 scholarship. As many of the top research institutions in the country are located outside Lisbon though, some program and institution are open to internationals studying with Portuguese host universities if funding is available.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like further details on any of these topics, or have any other questions.
